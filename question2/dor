Downing Street says there has been "no change"
 to plans for a UK state visit by US President Donald Trump.
It comes after the Guardian reported Mr Trump had called Prime
 Minister Theresa May to say he did not want to carry out the trip
 until he had support from the British public.

He was invited for the state visit by the Queen.

Mr Trump was criticised after attacking London Mayor Sadiq Khan over
 his response to the recent terror attacks.

Mr Khan had told the public they should not be alarmed at the
 increased police presence on the streets after the attacks on London
 Bridge and at Borough Market.

But Mr Trump then accused him via Twitter of making "pathetic excuses".
