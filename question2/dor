1) If Linked list is empty then make the node as head and return it.
2) If value of the node to be inserted is smaller than value of head node
    then insert the node at start and make it head.
3) In a loop, find the appropriate node after which the input node (let 9) is
    to be inserted. To find the appropriate node start from head, keep moving 
    until you reach a node GN (10 in the below diagram) who's value is 
    greater than the input node. The node just before GN is the appropriate
    node (7).
4) Insert the node (9) after the appropriate node (7) found in step 3.
The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is one of 
the main protocols of the Internet protocol suite. It 
originated in the initial network implementation in which it 
complemented the Internet Protocol (IP). Therefore, the entire suite is 
commonly referred to as TCP/IP. TCP provides reliable, ordered, and error-checked
 delivery of a stream of octets between applications running on
 hosts communicating by an IP network. Major Internet 
applications such as the World Wide Web, email, remote administration, and file transfer rely on
 TCP. Applications that do not require reliable data stream service may use the User Datagram
 Protocol (UDP), which provides a connectionless datagram service that emphasizes reduced latency over reliability.
